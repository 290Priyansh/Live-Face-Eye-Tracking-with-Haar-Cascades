# 👁️ Live Face & Eye Tracking with Haar Cascades

This project uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifiers to detect **faces** and **eyes** in real-time from your webcam. It draws bounding boxes around detected areas and displays the result in a mirrored live video feed.

> 🧪 This was me exploring Haar Cascade classifiers and getting hands-on with OpenCV basics.
